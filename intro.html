<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This version of FlatSiteBuilder is a preview to show possibilities.<br>
It is not meant to be a ready made product.<br>
There are still some features not implemented yet.</p>
<p>If you for example want to change site properties like the menus just edit the Site.xml associated with the website and reload it.<br>
Also if you want to change a theme or want to override theme assets or includes you have to do it by hand.<br>
Have a look at ~/FlatSiteBuilder/ </p>
